When a noun has feminine gender in German, what is the chance that the corresponding French noun is also feminine &mdash; is it better than a coin toss? I have downloaded a FR/DE dictionary from [here](https://www.dict.cc). I cannot include the file in the repo since that would violate the dict.cc ToS, but you can request it [here](https://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e) &mdash; pick option \"DE->FR (tab-delimited, UTF-8).

    "Of course, since French has no neutral gender but German has, the rightmost column must be empty. French's progenitor language Latin has three genders (as did the grandmother of them all, Proto-Indoeuropean), but many modern Romance languages whittled that down to just two &mdash; `m` and `f`. In Italian this happened roughly by merging masculine and neutral, it appears that French has had a similar development but it is less clear to me (I am not a linguist!). Some things may be muddier here: Latin argentum (n) &rarr; French argent (m); lac (n) &rarr; lait (m) BUT p≈çmum (n) &rarr; pomme (f); mare (n) &rarr; mer (f). We will be getting around to matching Latin and French noun genders later!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, let's make a simplifying assumption for now: that the elimination of neutral gender in French went along similar lines as in Italian, i.e. the majority of neutral nouns assumed masculine gender. Since French has arguably suffered (? or profited?) from Germanic influence more than other Romance languages, we could assume that that may have made things messier than in Italian. But looking at neutral german nouns (bottom row of plot above), they tend to be predominantly masculine in French &mdash; almost twice as often. Hence the influence can be assumed to be subdominant &mdash; it would certainly be less justified to assume that the majority of neutral nouns assumed the feminine gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, let us pour all German masculine and neutral nouns into a bucket and compare that across the two genders in French. The intention is to artificially emulate the historical evolution of Romance language, to allow us to compare if a noun is \"more of f or more of m\" across the two languages."
